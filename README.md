# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Use the standard libraries in python for finding linear regression.
2. Set variables for assigning dataset values.
3. Import linear regression from sklearn.
4. Predict the values of array.
5. Calculate the accuracy, confusion and classification report by importing the required modules from sklearn.
6. Obtain the graph.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.
Developed by: Keerthika N
RegisterNumber: 212221230049
*/
```
```

```
## Output:
Array Value of x

Array Value of y

Exam 1 - score graph

Sigmoid function graph

X_train_grad value

Y_train_grad value

Print res.x

Decision boundary - graph for exam score

Proability value

Prediction value of mean

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent is written and verified using python programming.
